#INO 124
A fictive scenario for Simbiz.

## The following items exist in this repo
The file `/data/sellingresults.csv`
Contains the previous selling results for the business.
This is used by `/src/sell_proj.py` to predict future growth.
The result from that program is stored in the results directory.


## How to run the code
To generate the graphs in the results directory run the following in your Linux terminal.

``` BASH
$ cd src
$ python sell_proj.py
```

If a window with the graph show up just close it with the q key.
